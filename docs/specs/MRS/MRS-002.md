# CTI knowledge base

The SATRAP-DL system, called SATRAP, SHALL host a native semantic CTI repository (a.k.a. CTI semantic knowledge base or CTI SKB) to enable by design the storage, management, and retrieval of information by means of semantic technologies.

### Rationale
The main goal of the project is to enrich the automation capabilities of current approaches by working with semantically enriched data and automated reasoning on such data.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
