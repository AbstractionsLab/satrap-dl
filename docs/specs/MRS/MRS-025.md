# SATRAP-DL service

SATRAP-DL SHALL provide a service to process CTI queries provided via the frontend, relay them to the CTI analysis component and return the response to the user in a pre-defined format.

### Rationale
Instead of navigating the data space, CTI analysts can ask direct questions (functions) with specific data and automatically obtain answers based on explicit and derived CTI.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
