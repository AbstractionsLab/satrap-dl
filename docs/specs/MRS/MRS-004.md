# SKB data model flexibility

The CTI SKB SHALL rely on a database solution supporting structural modifications to the data model without requiring a data schema migration, e.g., in a relational DBMS needing a schema migration tool.

### Rationale
CTI relationships are complex and often uncertain, thus, subject to frequent changes. A flexible data model accommodates for those evolving requirements.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
