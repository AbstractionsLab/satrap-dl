# Secure channels to the CyFORT ecosystem

The communication between separate components of the SATRAP-DL system crossing through different trust boundaries
SHALL occur over confidential and authenticated channels.

### Rationale
Integration of tools within the CyFORT ecosystem enables the exchange of information managed by internal tools.
Such data might be available only to authorized users in the organization, hence, it should be by default protected
from external parties.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
