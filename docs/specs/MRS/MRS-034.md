# Frontend cross-platform support

The frontend SHALL be cross-platform compatible, either by providing dedicated platform-dependent deployment artifacts (e.g., build binaries for GNU/Linux and MacOS) or rely on technology enabling cross-platform support by design, e.g., web-based stacks or containerization solutions.

### Rationale
For portability and compatibility with prevailing operating systems

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
