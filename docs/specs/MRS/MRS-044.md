# Modular architecture

The design of the SATRAP-DL system SHALL follow a modular architecture according to software design criteria specified, e.g., in the SWEBOK.

### Rationale
As an open-source project, extensions by the community are expected, e.g., for supporting standards and tool interoperability. This requirement aims to facilitate smooth code integration.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
