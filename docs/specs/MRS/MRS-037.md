# SATRAP as software library

The SATRAP-DL system, called SATRAP, SHALL implement a native library grouping together a set of low-level algorithms to provide high-level CTI analysis services (functionality) and to facilitate the use of SATRAP as a software library from external applications.

### Rationale
For interoperability with the ecosystem, to enable the automation of the CTI lifecycle through the integration of multiple complementary solutions.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
