  The SATRAP-DL system SHALL implement a mechanism for raw (i.e., prior to SATRAP inference) CTI storage in a CTI repository maintained using at least one open-source TIP with sharing capabilities (e.g., MISP or OpenCTI). This upstream SATRAP CTI repository maintained by one or more open-source TIPs will be referred to as the CyFORT CTI repository.

  ### Rationale
  To leverage the mature and robust data collection, storage and sharing capabilities of existing TIPs and because many CSIRT/CERT and SOC teams already maintain their repositories in such platforms.
