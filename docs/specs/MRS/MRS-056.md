# Access control

The SATRAP-DL connectors (for ingestion and enrichment) SHALL rely on the built-in functionality of the integrated open-source TIP(s) (i.e., CyFORT CTI repository) to enforce access control and role-based access management.

### Rationale
Separation of roles should be implemented to address security concerns, and to provide information and relevant functionalities according to the type of user.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
