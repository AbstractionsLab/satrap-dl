# Storage of CTI investigations

The frontend SHALL allow the user to create and save CTI investigation notes, e.g., a step by step investigation notebook with results obtained from the SATRAP-DL service layer.

### Rationale
To allow for the creation of reusable playbooks for common cases of CTI analysis and to save reproducible work in progress.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
