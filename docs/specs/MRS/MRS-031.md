# Frontend STIX compliance

When terms coming from different CTI sources are used to refer to the same CTI concept, the frontend SHOULD provide a mapping to the equivalent concept in STIX.

Among other features, usage of a common vocabulary is essential for the adoption of tools in a given application domain.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
