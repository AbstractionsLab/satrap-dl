# CyFORT CTI repository

The SATRAP-DL system, called SATRAP, SHALL implement a mechanism for storing and accessing CTI information in and from a repository consisting of one or more open-source TIPs with sharing capabilities (e.g., MISP or OpenCTI). This upstream CTI repository will be referred to as the CyFORT CTI repository.

### Rationale
To leverage the mature and robust data collection, storage and sharing capabilities of existing TIPs and to facilitate integration as many CSIRT/CERT and SOC teams already maintain their repositories in such platforms.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
