# File-based SKB update

The frontend MAY allow the user to update the SKB by loading CTI content from files encoded using a predefined format (e.g., JSON) and according to a well-defined specification (e.g., STIX).

### Rationale
To keep the CTI updated by the users themselves.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
