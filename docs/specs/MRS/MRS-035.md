# Integration with open-source tools for incident handling

SATRAP-DL SHALL integrate at least two open-source cybersecurity tools to support CTI-informed
incident handling; for instance, a SIEM as the threat data source, and a case management tool to create incident cases if considered relevant after an analysis using SATRAP.

### Rationale
1. To support investigations facilitating immediate access to CTI for reacting in an adequate way.
2. To use and enrich the open-source ecosystem in a coherent and interoperable manner, fostering
adoption of SATRAP-DL.

### Acceptance criteria
Successful validation according to the corresponding test case specification
