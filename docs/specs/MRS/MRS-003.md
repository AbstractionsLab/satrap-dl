# CTI SKB extensibility

The CTI SKB SHALL support the integration of new concepts (e.g., facts, entities, or relationships) while maintaining the existing core data model.

### Rationale
Extensibility of the data model allows for gradual enrichment of the CTI SKB by combining multiple threat frameworks, as CTI might not be expressible in a single one.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
