# Inspect settings for CM

Inspect the centralized settings file to verify that some of its content is read from a user-controller configuration management file allowing configuration management without requiring software rebuild.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps
1. Navigate to the `settings.py` file at `satrap/settings.py`.
2. Navigate to the YAML configuration management file `satrap/assets/satrap_params.yml` exposed to and managed by the user.
3. Check that the YAML file is read into memory (e.g., in a Python dictionary).
4. Check that at least one parameter in `settings.py` is read from the in-memory copy of the `satrap_params.yml` file.

## Expected outcome
4. At least one entry containing a runtime variable assignment making use of the in-memory copy of the configuration/parameters YAML file, e.g.,

```
VARIABLE = satrap_parameters_dictionary.get('key-1').get('key-2')
```
