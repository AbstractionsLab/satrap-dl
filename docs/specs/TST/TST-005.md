# Verify centralized management

Verify centralized management of system parameters customization (e.g., logging severity, db connections, file paths) via a dedicated configuration file, log storage, exception types and error messages.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps
1. Verify that system parameters for logging severity can be customized in a centralized manner: e.g., logging severity: debug, info, warn, error
1. Verify that system parameters for db connections can be customized in a centralized manner.
1. Verify that system parameters for file paths can be managed from a dedicated, centralized configuration file.
1. Verify that there is a designated centralized location for storing logs.
1. Verify that exceptions are specified in a centralized manner, e.g., by maintaining all the error codes in a configuration file.

## Expected outcome
Embedded in test steps.
