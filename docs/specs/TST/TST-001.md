# Verify data modelling artifacts

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL system concept documents
- Access to the SATRAP-DL database schema
- Access to the SATRAP-DL system deployment artifacts
- Access to the SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps

1. Review the SATRAP-DL system concept documents, database schema, deployment artifacts and source code to verify the linked requirements related to data modelling, database paradigm, integration of semantic search capable technology and flexibility of DBMS.
1. Check for alignment by comparing the system concept documents with the database schema and deployment artifacts to ensure that there is consistency between them, e.g., that the database schema accurately reflects the data model specified in the documents.

## Expected outcome
As the verification method of this TC is review of design, the expected outcomes are already embedded in the test steps.
