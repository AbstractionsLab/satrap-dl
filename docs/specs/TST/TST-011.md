# Test Jupyter notebook frontend

Test that the provided Jupyter notebook frontend executes as expected.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to source code of SATRAP-DL
- Access to SATRAP-DL deployment artifacts
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) (or daemon) running with the right privileges for the testing user
- Successful execution of the `init-satrap.sh` script
- SATRAP Docker container created using the `build-satrap.sh` script
- Microsoft [VS Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed (v1.98.2)
- Microsoft VS Code Studio [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) installed, i.e., the VS Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (v0.401.0)

### Test dependencies
- **TST-008** executed successfully

## Test steps
1. Open the source code of SATRAP-DL (here we assume the use of VS Code) and open the project in the dev container (see the README).
2. Navigate to the VS Code Studio terminal and create a new Terminal (if a prompt not available) to access the SATRAP container file system and run `poetry shell`, followed by `poetry install`.
3. Navigate to the folder `satrap/frontend/quick_start.ipynb` and using the `Select kernel` button, choose the Python environment that was just activated and prepared using the commands in the previous step.
4. Run each cell from top to bottom in order.

## Expected outcome
4. The obtained outcome must match the test data evidence available in `satrap/docs/specs/TST/assets/quick_start-test-reference.ipynb`.
