# Verify CTI SKB inference rules

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps
1. Verify that SATRAP-DL implements inference rules that allow for the automated derivation of knowledge over existing relations in the CTI SKB by inspecting the CTI SKB inference rule definition file and CTI SKB type definitions files stored in the `satrap/assets/schema` folder.

## Expected outcome
Embedded in test steps.
