# Verify ETL architecture

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL system concept documents

## Test steps
1. Verify that the system architecture considers a component (here the ETL subsystem) to deal with the ETL process.
2. Verify that the ETL subsystem includes a component in charge of orchestrating the full extract-transform-load (ETL) process.
3. Verify that the ETL subsystem has a dedicated component for the ingestion of datasets in STIX 2.1.
4. Verify that the ETL subsystem includes a component in charge of transforming data in STIX 2.1 format into the representation language of the the CTI SKB schema.
5. Verify that the ETL subsystem has a component responsible for the insertion of content into the CTI SKB.
6. Verify that SATRAP-DL provides a component in charge of managing database operations and connections.

## Expected outcome
Embedded in test steps.
