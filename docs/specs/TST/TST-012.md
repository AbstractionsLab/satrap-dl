# Test ETL logging

Validate the logging feature of the ETL subsystem.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to source code of SATRAP-DL
- Access to SATRAP-DL deployment artifacts
- Access to the internet or a pre-downloaded copy of MITRE ATT&CK data sets in STIX 2.1, e.g., the enterprise TTPs
- TypeDB Docker container pulled and running using the `init-satrap.sh` script
- SATRAP Docker network created using the `init-satrap.sh` script
- SATRAP volume for persistent TypeDB storage created using the `init-satrap.sh` script
- Docker Engine (or daemon) running with the right privileges for the testing user
- `TypeDB Studio` version `2.28.6` installed (alternatively you can interact with the TypeDB backend directly via its CLI)
- A plain/empty project created in TypeDB Studio
- SATRAP Docker container created using the `build-satrap.sh` script

### Test dependencies
- **TST-008** executed successfully

## Test steps
1. Run `./satrap.sh etl` to launch the default ETL job, fetching a MITRE ATT&CK Mobile data set.

## Expected outcome
1. Check the generated log in the `satrap/assets/logs` folder (under date folders and timestamped files according to ETL execution time) to validate the following:

- a log entry is generated at the beginning of the job, indicating the start time
- each log entry recording an event comes with a log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- there is at least a log entry for each ETL phase (i.e., extraction, transformation and loading) describing the status in terms of success/failure and some minimal hint or additional information explaining or complementing the execution status.
