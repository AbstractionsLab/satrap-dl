# TC: Verify software engineering

Verify that the design and implementation of SATRAP-DL adheres to software best practices.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps
1. Verify the consistent use of naming conventions.
1. Verify adherence to SOLID, the 5 principles of object-oriented design SOLID principles.

## Expected outcome
