# TC: Verify secure programming

Ensure various input sanitization and validation security measures are in place.

## Preconditions and setup actions
- Access to the SATRAP-DL data models and database schema
- Access to the SATRAP-DL source code

## Test steps
1. Verify that SATRAP-DL components receiving input validate the input and reject it in case the validation fails; the validation may include integrity checks, syntactic checks, semantic checks, parameter out-of-range checks, etc.
1. Verify that SATRAP-DL perform sanitization of input and output (data passed across a trust boundary); sanitization may include removing, replacing, encoding, or escaping unwanted characters.
1. Verify that network connections and other resources accessed are properly terminated when they are no longer required.
1. Verify that all software dependencies including 3rd-party libraries are listed and maintained in a configuration file.
1. Verify that log strings are sanitized and validated before being logging to prevent log injection attacks.
1. Verify that SATRAP-DL does not log sensitive information such as passwords or entity identifiers.
1. Verify that the data model enforces semantic integrity ensuring that relationships and constraints adhere to the intended meaning; this can be based on measures such as data validation with respect to schemas and relationship constraints, technical possibility of automated checks for data redundancy and inference powered by a reasoning engine.

## Expected outcome
Embedded in test steps.
