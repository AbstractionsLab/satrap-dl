  ## STIX-specific ETL class diagram

  A concrete class definition aimed at ingesting data form sources in STIX 2.1 is depicted below. This classes implement and inherit from the abstract classes depicted in SWD-001.

  ![Concrete STIX-specific ETL class diagram](assets/2C0A2B_DIA_Specific-ETL-design.drawio.png "Concrete STIX-specific ETL class diagram"){: width="50%"}

  For instance, to provide an implementation of the ETL process to ingest MITRE ATT&CK data in STIX 2.1 format, transform and load into a TypeDB database with a schema close to STIX 2.1, concrete implementations of the ETL classes are required.

  For this, we use 2 extractors, namely a Downloader which downloads a file and saves it and a STIXExtractor which reads a STIX 2.1 JSON file and provides its content as Python objects.

  Then, a transformer called STIXtoTypeQLTransformer will take these STIX 2.1 objects and transform them to TypeQL insertion query objects according to the defined schema.

  After the transformer has finished its work, the TypeDBLoader can take these insertion query objects and insert them into the TypeDB database instance.
