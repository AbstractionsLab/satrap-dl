# TCER: centralized management 

We report on our inspection to verify centralized management of system parameters customization via a dedicated configuration file, and of log storage, exception types and error messages.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A 
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

SATRAP-DL enables customization of system parameters via a YAML file located at `satrap/assets/satrap_params.yml`, capturing logging mode, TypeDB database parameters (host, port, db name) and ETL default source files/paths.

**Test case step 1**: Verify centralized system parameterization

- ?c5-defect-0: The user-controlled YAML file `satrap_params.yml` captures logging mode.

**Test case step 2**: Verify centralized parameterization for database connections

- ?c5-defect-0: The user-controlled YAML file `satrap_params.yml` captures TypeDB database parameters (host, port, db name) 

**Test case step 3**: Verify centralized parameterization file for managing file paths

- ?c5-defect-0: The `settings.py` encapsulates paths to various resources used throughout the code.

**Test case step 4**: Verify designated logs storage location

- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP-DL stores its logs under `satrap/assets/logs`, with log files organized under subfolders named by date, which in turn contain timestamped logs files capturing the name of the log producing module.

**Test case step 5**: Verify centralized exception definitions

- ?c5-defect-0: Exceptions are defined in a centralized manner and stored in `satrap/commons/exceptions.py`.
