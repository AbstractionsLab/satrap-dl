# TCER: SATRAP architecture

This test case execution report verifies the existence of CTI analysis components in the architecture of SATRAP. See the linked files for precise references to the cited code modules and classes.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify that the system includes a dedicated module or component encapsulating the analytic functions provided by SATRAP.

- ?c5-defect-0: The CTI analysis engine is depicted in the system architecture designs. More over, the implementation contains a `satrap/engine` package which includes the class `CTIEngine` (in `cti_engine.py`); this class encapsulates the core analytic functionality directly interacting with the database manager. Query statements and result structures are part of this package too.

**Test case step 2**: Verify that the system includes a dedicated module or component aimed at providing the end-user functionality to be serviced by the system.

- ?c5-defect-0: The architectural diagrams contain a service component providing analytical functions. This design is satisfied in the implementation by the `satrap/service` package, in particular via the `CTIanalysisToolbox` class in the `satrap_analysis.py` module.

**Test case step 3**: Verify that the frontend is designed to interact with the service layer of SATRAP.

- ?c5-defect-0: the `quick_start.ipynb` Jupyter notebook included in the `satrap/frontend` package shows an example of how to use the `CTIanalysisToolbox` service component in this frontend interface.
