# TCER: ETL logging

We ran tests to validate the logging feature of the ETL subsystem.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specification

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify ETL logging by running `./satrap.sh etl` to ingest the latest version of the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise data set

?c5-defect-0: The generated log, i.e., `test-evidence-log.txt`, stored in the `satrap/assets/logs` folder was checked (stored under date folders and timestamped files according to ETL execution time) and the following items were validated:

- a log entry is generated at the beginning of the job, indicating the start time
- each log entry recording an event comes with a log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- there is at least a log entry for each ETL phase (i.e., extraction, transformation and loading) describing the status in terms of success/failure and some minimal hint or additional information explaining or complementing the execution status.
