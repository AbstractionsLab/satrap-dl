# TCER: code clarity

We report on our code inspections to validate the logging feature of the ETL subsystem.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify source code clarity according to the C5-DEC method and guidelines

- ?c5-defect-0: The majority of the SATRAP-DL code base exhibits a high degree of consistency in terms of understandability, readability and being well-documented.
