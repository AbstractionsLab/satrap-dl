# TCER: Open-source TIP adoption

We reviewed the SATRAP design artifacts to validate its adoption of open-source TIPs by design, specifically MISP and OpenCTI.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify SATRAP adoption of open-source TIPs

- ?c5-defect-0: we confirmed upon reviewing the SATRAP system concept documents that it adopts both MISP and OpenCTI as TIPs.
