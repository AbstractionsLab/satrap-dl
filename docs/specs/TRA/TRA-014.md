# TCER: SATRAP CLI

We report on our tests carried out using the SATRAP command line interface (CLI) to verify that it provides at least the commands specified in the software requirement specification (SRS) that the linked test case specification traces to.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specification

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Run `./satrap.sh rules`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.

**Test case step 2**: Run `./satrap.sh stats`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.

**Test case step 3**: Run `./satrap.sh techniques`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.

**Test case step 4**: Run `./satrap.sh mitigations`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.

**Test case step 5**: Run `./satrap.sh search campaign--0c259854-4044-4f6c-ac49-118d484b3e3b`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.

**Test case step 6**: Run `./satrap.sh info_mitre T1027.001`

- ?c5-defect-0: obtained result consistent with the expected outcome specified in the linked test case.
