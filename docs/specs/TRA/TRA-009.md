# TCER: ETL architecture

This test case execution report covers the ETL subsystem; see the linked files for precise references to the cited code modules and classes mentioned below.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify data integration module for orchestration

- ?c5-defect-0: As part of its dedicated ETL subsystem, SATRAP provides a module in charge of orchestrating (`etlorchestrator.py`), another for the ingestion (`extractor.py`) of datasets in STIX 2.1 and, finally, another module for the insertion (`loader.py`) of content into the SATRAP CTI SKB, powered by TypeDB.

**Test case step 2**: Verify the integration module for transforming data into STIX 2.1

- ?c5-defect-0: As part of its dedicated ETL subsystem, SATRAP provides a module in charge of transforming (`transformer.py`) the ingested STIX data into the representation language of the CTI SKB schema, namely TypeQL.

**Test case step 3**: Verify data integration module for database operations and connections

- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP provides a dedicated data management package containing various related modules, with one in particular (`typedbmanager.py`) in charge of managing database operations and connections.

### Defect summary description
