# TCER: ETL architecture

This test case execution report covers the ETL subsystem; see the linked files for precise references to the cited code modules and classes mentioned below.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify existence of an ETL subsystem

- ?c5-defect-0: The architecture and logic view diagrams depict the ETL component. More over, the artifacts linked to SRS-008 show dedicated conceptual and software diagrams concerning the design of the ETL subsystem. The ETL subsystem is implemented in the `satrap/etl` package.

**Test case step 2**: Verify ETL orchestration component

- ?c5-defect-0: As part of its dedicated ETL subsystem, SATRAP provides the orchestration module `etlorchestrator.py`, for managing the Extract, Transform, and Load process.

**Test case step 3**: Verify extractor

- ?c5-defect-0: the extraction components supporting the ingestion of datasets in STIX 2.1 are implemented in the `satrap/et/extract` package. The core logic is implemented in the `extractor.py` module.

**Test case step 4**: Verify the module for transforming data into STIX 2.1

- ?c5-defect-0: As part of its dedicated ETL subsystem, SATRAP provides a module in charge of transforming (`transformer.py`) the ingested STIX data into the representation language of the CTI SKB schema, namely TypeQL.

**Test case step 5**: Verify component for insertion into the CTI SKB

- ?c5-defect-0: the components supporting the load of ingested content into the SATRAP CTI SKB, powered by TypeDB, are implemented in the `satrap/et/load` package (`loader.py`).

**Test case step 6**: Verify data integration module for database operations and connections

- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP provides a dedicated data management package containing various related modules, with one in particular (`typedbmanager.py`) in charge of managing database operations and connections.
