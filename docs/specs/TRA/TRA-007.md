# TCER: secure programming

This test case execution report addresses the validation test case dealing with secure programming aspects and practices.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify components input validation

- ?c5-defect-2: while most SATRAP components receiving input perform some form of validation, we have identified a few discrepancies such as those in the ETL `extractor` module. The `fetch` functions in the `Downloader` and `STIXExtractor` do not validate the source URLs or file paths against a reference pattern or inclusion in any black or white lists. They do however perform syntactic checks directly and indirectly via the `validate_file` function in the `file_utils` module.

**Test case step 2**: Verify sanitization of input and output of data passing across trust boundaries

- ?c5-defect-0: since integration with TIPs or other external sources residing outside the SATRAP trust boundary is currently not implemented as part of the alpha release (requirements for beta release), this sanitization requirements is considered to be satisfied.

**Test case step 3**: Verify resource liberation

- ?c5-defect-0: the ETL subsystem and various functions making I/O operations correctly release resources, e.g., database network connections and file streams handled via `with` context managers.

**Test case step 4**: Verify SBOM usage

- ?c5-defect-0: all software dependencies of SATRAP, thanks to use its of Poetry, are listed precisely in an inventory providing a software bill of material (SBOM), that lists all used libraries, their respective versions, along with the corresponding hashes (automatically generated lock file).

**Test case step 5**: Verify log string sanitization

- ?c5-defect-2: log strings are currently not sanitized and validated before being logging to prevent log injection attacks.

Log injection vulnerabilities can emerge when writing invalidated user input to log files can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into the logs; the data can enter an application from an untrusted source (N/A in the alpha release of SATRAP) or it can be written to an application or system log file. (applicable to the alpha release)

A note on log forging (source: [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection))
> In the most benign case, an attacker may be able to insert false entries into the log file by providing the application with input that includes appropriate characters. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected characters. A more subtle attack might involve skewing the log file statistics. Forged or otherwise, corrupted log files can be used to cover an attackerâ€™s tracks or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act.

**Test case step 6**: Verify secret storage

- ?c5-defect-0: Manual and automated scans (SAST) confirm the absence of logged or hardcoded sensitive information in the source code such as passwords or entity identifiers.

**Test case step 7**: Verify data semantic integrity enforcement

- ?c5-defect-0: the TypeDB engine, together with the SATRAP data model and TypeQL types (`cti-skb-types.tql`) enforce semantic integrity ensuring that relationships and constraints adhere to the intended meaning. These enable benefitting from measures such as data validation with respect to schemas and relationship constraints, technical possibility of automated checks for data redundancy and inference powered by a reasoning engine.
