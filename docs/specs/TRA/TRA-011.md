# TCER: Jupyter Notebook frontend

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specification

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Open the source code of SATRAP-DL in Microsoft VS Code Studio using the Dev Containers extension

- ?c5-defect-0: The project loaded successfully, with a bash session being the entry point selected by default, giving access to the SATRAP GNU/Linux container.

**Test case step 2**: Navigate to the VS Code Studio terminal and activate Python environment

- ?c5-defect-0: The SATRAP container was successfully accessed, and the commands `poetry shell` and `poetry install` also successfully run.

**Test case step 3**: Navigate to the folder `satrap/frontend/quick_start.ipynb` and activate kernel

- ?c5-defect-0: Jupyter Notebook located successfully and kernel activated.

**Test case step 4**: Run each cell from top to bottom in order

- ?c5-defect-0: All cells executed, and their outputs were successfully compared to the expected output reference file `quick_start-test-reference.ipynb`.

Part 1 on "Starting with simple functions":

- ?c5-defect-0: `satrap = CTIanalysisToolbox(TYPEDB_SERVER_ADDRESS, DB_NAME)`
- ?c5-defect-0: `print(satrap.get_sdo_stats())`
- ?c5-defect-0: `print(satrap.mitre_attack_techniques())`
- ?c5-defect-0: `print(satrap.mitre_attack_mitigations())`
- ?c5-defect-0: cell "Get information on a specific MITRE ATT&CK element (technique, group, software, etc.) using its MITRE ATT&CK id."
- ?c5-defect-0: cell "Get information about a STIX object using its STIX id."
- ?c5-defect-0: cell "Retrieve mitigations explicitly associated to a specific technique using its STIX id."

Part 2 on "CTI analysis through automated reasoning":

- ?c5-defect-0: cell "Get statistics on the usage of ATT&CK techniques by groups. The output of this function is the same as when running the command `satrap techniques` on the CLI."
- ?c5-defect-0: cell `display(satrap.techniques_usage(infer=True))`
- ?c5-defect-0: cell `techniques = satrap.techniques_used_by_group("G0025", infer=True)`
- ?c5-defect-0: cell `display(satrap.related_mitigations(group_name="BlackTech"))`

Subsection "Explanation of inferred knowledge"

- ?c5-defect-0: 1st cell starting with `rel_explanation = satrap.explain_if_related_mitigation("G0098", "course-of-action--20a2baeb-98c2-4901-bad7-dc62d0a03dea")`.
- ?c5-defect-0: 2nd cell starting with `reason = satrap.explain_related_techniques("ZIRCONIUM", "T1059.006")`.
- ?c5-defect-0: last cell starting with `dg_explanation = satrap.explain_techniques_used_by_group("G0071", "Domain Groups")`.

### Defect summary description

Defect-free test execution, i.e., defect category: ?c5-defect-0

### Text execution evidence

See linked files (if any), e.g., screenshots, logs, etc.

### Comments

The function signature `t1 = satrap.get_attck_concept_info("T1027.001")` contains a typo: `attck` -> `attack`

Functions are named inconsistently: there is a mix of verb-based (preferred as per C5-DEC conventions) and noun-based naming, e.g.,

  - `satrap.get_sdo_stats()`
  - `satrap.mitre_attack_techniques()`
  - `satrap.mitigations_for_technique()`
  - `satrap.get_attck_concept_info()`
  - `satrap.search_stix_object()`
