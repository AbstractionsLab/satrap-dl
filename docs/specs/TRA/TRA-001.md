# TCER: modelling

This test case execution result (TCER) reports the outcome of verifying modelling artifacts.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify linked requirements

- ?c5-defect-0: The data model of SATRAP-DL uses a data modelling language based on type theory, namely TypeQL. 
- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP-DL relies on a database paradigm that allows for knowledge representation based on semantics and PERA model implemented by TypeDB.
- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP-DL supports querying the CTI SKB based on semantic criteria.
- ?c5-defect-0: The data model of the CTI SKB is extensible and allows for the integration of new information.
- ?c5-defect-0: The data model of the CTI SKB SHALL relies on a type-theoretic polymorphic entity-relation-attribute (PERA) data model to allow for the addition of new entities and relationships without requiring a schema migration.

**Test case step 2**: Check for alignment between system concept and implemented system

- ?c5-defect-0: alignment confirmed upon reviewing design artifacts and comparing these against the implementation.
