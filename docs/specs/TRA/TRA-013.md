# TCER: CM settings

We report on our inspection of the centralized settings file to verify that some of its content is read from a user-controller configuration management file allowing configuration management without requiring software rebuild.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Navigate to the `settings.py`

- ?c5-defect-0: The file `settings.py` was located at `satrap/settings.py`.

**Test case step 2**: Navigate to the YAML configuration management

- ?c5-defect-0: The configuration management file `satrap_params.yml` exposed to the user was found at `satrap/assets/satrap_params.yml`.

**Test case step 3**: Check that the YAML file is read into memory (e.g., in a Python dictionary).

- ?c5-defect-0: this was validated the `settings.py` file `read_yaml(SATRAP_PARAMS_FILE_PATH)`; see linked files section for the precise, automatically retrieved line number.

**Test case step 4**: Check that at least one settings parameter read into memory

- ?c5-defect-0: parameters in `settings.py` are populated from the in-memory copy of the `satrap_params.yml` file, with an example given below

```
HOST = satrap_params_dict.get('typedb').get('host','typedb')
```
