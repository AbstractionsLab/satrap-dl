# TCER: SW engineering

This test case execution result (TCER) reports the outcome of the verification of naming convention usage and adherence to the SOLID software engineering principles.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A 
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify consistent naming convention use

- ?c5-defect-1: based on a sample of the source files, most functions, classes and variables follow the PEP-8 naming convention consistently. Nevertheless, we did identify one problematic instance in the `log_utils.py` module, see the comments section below for more details.

**Test case step 2**: Verify adherence to SOLID

- ?c5-defect-0: the 5 SOLID design principles are largely respected by the architectural modules.

### Defect summary description

An insignificant defect was detected during test execution, i.e., thus assigning the overall highest defect category from the test step verdicts: ?c5-defect-1

Please see the comments below for a few relevant observations.

### Text execution evidence

See linked files (if any), e.g., screenshots, logs, etc.

### Comments

The function definition `testing(self, ...)` in `satrap/commons/log_utils.py`: a function at the module level has a `self` parameter in its signature, as opposed to being used in instance methods within class definitions to refer to the instance of the class; see linked file for exact reference.
