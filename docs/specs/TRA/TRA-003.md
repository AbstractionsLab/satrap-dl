# TCER: STIX and reasoning 

This test case execution result (TCER) reports the outcome of STIX and reasoning engine usage verification.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify DBMS technology

- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP-DL uses a DBMS technology that comes with a reasoning engine as a key integral part, namely TypeDB.

**Test case step 2**: Verify use of STIX 2.1

- ?c5-defect-0: SATRAP-DL uses STIX 2.1 as the default standard format for CTI representation.
