# TCER: Semantic data integrity

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: aligned with test case specification, N/A
- Hardware deviations: aligned with test case specification, N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify that the system enforces semantic integrity of data

- ?c5-defect-0: According to the system concept documentation of SATRAP-DL, in particular based on the document `2B1C_REP_CyFORT-SATRAP-DL-DetailedStudy-CTI-SKB_v1.0`, this requirement is covered by consistency and correctness checks performed automatically by TypeDB. This native validations include [schema validation](https://typedb.com/docs/academy/5-defining-schemas/5.5-schema-validation) at creation time and [data validation w.r.t. a database schema](https://typedb.com/docs/academy/4-writing-data/4.5-data-validation) when inserting data into a database.
