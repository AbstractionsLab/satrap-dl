# TCER: CTI SKB inference

This test case execution report covers the SATRAP automated reasoning and inference capabilities; see the linked files for precise references to the cited files.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify that SATRAP-DL implements inference rules for automated reasoning

- ?c5-defect-0: The SATRAP implementation provides a dedicated rules file (`cti-skb-rules.tql`). By analyzing the CTI SKB inference rule definition file and CTI SKB type definitions files stored in the `satrap/assets/schema`, we confirm the presence of the required artifacts enabling derivation of knowledge over existing relations in the CTI SKB powered by TypeDB.
