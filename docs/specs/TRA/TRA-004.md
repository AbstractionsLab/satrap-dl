# TCER: data model

We analyze the SATRAP data model to verify adherence to that of STIX 2.1.

## Relevant test environment and configuration details

- Software deviations: N/A
- Hardware deviations: N/A

## Test execution results

Here we report the results in terms of step-wise alignments or deviations with respect to the expected outcome of the covered test case.

**Test case step 1**: Verify data model alignment with STIX 2.1

- ?c5-defect-1: support for ingesting STIX 2.1 is implemented, providing a direct mapping of the imported data to equivalent concepts in the TypeDB database; however, custom and metadata objects are currently missing.

### Defect summary description

Assigned defect category: ?c5-defect-1

STIX 2.1 is currently not complete (custom properties and meta objects currently not handled), but sufficient coverage is provided for the alpha release.

### Text execution evidence
