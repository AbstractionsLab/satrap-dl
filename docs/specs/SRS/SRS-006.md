# Integration of common CTI

_As an_ administrator of SATRAP, _I want_ to run an ETL pipeline that retrieves MITRE ATT&CK datasets published in STIX 2.1, transforms the content into an adequate format and loads this content into the CTI SKB, _so that_ I have up-to-date, reliable and curated data available for automated reasoning and analysis.

For this purpose:

1. I have a way to configure the MITRE ATT&CK STIX 2.1 source URL or local file
2. I can run the integration process from the CLI of SATRAP
2. SATRAP runs the ETL pipeline to downloads/reads the STIX 2.1 payload, transform STIX into the internal TypeQL load statements and insert them into the CTI SKB
4. I get notified of API authentication failures, network errors, and invalid STIX payloads with clear error messages and appropriate exit codes
5. I get a summary at the end the ETL process and can see the log for detailed information.

### Rationale
For scenarios that deal with CTI generation and operation, we consider that a knowledge base requires information from at least three categories integrating
both, public and internal threat landscapes.
This requirement addresses the integration of common cybersecurity knowledge.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
