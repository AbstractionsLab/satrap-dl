# Command line interface (CLI)

_As a_ SATRAP administrator/CTI analyst, _I want to_ interact with SATRAP via a command line interface
_so that_ I can set up the backend CTI SKB and launch the ETL pipeline without the need of a graphical user interface (GUI).
Thus, I want the CLI to provide at least the following commands:

- `setup`: Initialize the CTI SKB.
- `etl`: Launch the ETL pipeline.
- `help`: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Rationale
To provide easy-to-use and efficient access to core data processing functionality for users who prefer command line tools.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
