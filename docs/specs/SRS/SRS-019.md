# CTI export to STIX 2.1

SATRAP SHALL provide a feature for obtaining the results of CTI analysis toolbox
inference functions in STIX 2.1 format.

### Rationale
For persistence of the analysis results in a standard human-readable format,
and for enabling transfer of newly derived CTI into other tools (e.g., the CyFORT CTI repository).

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
