# OSINT feeds configuration and catalog

The CyFORT CTI repository instantiated by MISP and/or OpenCTI SHOULD ingest a pre-configured set of OSINT feeds, informed
by a catalog documenting relevant feeds per application domain (e.g. energy sector, space sector, IT company, etc.).

### Rationale
To integrate up to date relevant CTI in SATRAP according to the domain of interest. The catalog acts as a reusable knowledge
base that supports the setup of new SATRAP deployments in diverse application domains.

### Acceptance criteria
None
