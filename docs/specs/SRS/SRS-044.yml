  The SATRAP-DL system SHALL adopt both MISP and OpenCTI as open-source TIPs (Threat Intelligence Platform) to
  manage threat intelligence data.

  ### Rationale
  To host and manage CTI data, by relying on stable and mature solutions, without reinventing the wheel.
  The choice of integrating a well-established open-source TIP would

  - provide a solution capable of ingesting, storing,
  and distributing threat intelligence data from various sources, including
  open-source feeds, commercial feeds, and internal sources.
  - provide a user-friendly interface for analysts to search, filter, and visualize
  threat intelligence data.
  - support integration with other security  tools and platforms, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
  systems, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms,
  and threat intelligence sharing platforms.
  - support standardized formats for threat intelligence data, such as STIX (Structured
  Threat Information Expression) and TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of
  Indicator Information), to facilitate interoperability with other systems.
  - support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence
  feeds, including the ability to schedule updates and manage data retention
  policies.
  - support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence reports, including the ability to generate reports in
  various formats, such as PDF, HTML, and CSV.
  - support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence dashboards, including the
  ability to customize the layout and content of the dashboards.
  - support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence alerts,
  including the ability to configure alert thresholds and notification
  mechanisms.
