# Extensibility of the data model

The data model of the CTI SKB SHALL be extensible to accommodate for the integration of new information (e.g., facts, entities, or relationships) without requiring a complete redesign.

### Rationale
Extensibility of the data model allows for gradual enrichment of the CTI SKB by combining multiple threat frameworks, as CTI might not be expressible in a single one.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
