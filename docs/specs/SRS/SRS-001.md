# Data modelling language

The data model of SATRAP SHALL be specified using a data modelling language based on description logics, such as OWL,
or on type theory such as TypeQL.

### Rationale
To enforce a rigorous logical model specification close to the conceptual model where the semantics of information are captured.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
