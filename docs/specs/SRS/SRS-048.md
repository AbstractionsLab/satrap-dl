# Integration of security tools for automation

_As a_ SOAR operator, _I want to_ integrate my SIEM and my case management systems with the CyFORT CTI repository,
_so that_ I can enable automated execution of workflows.

1. I use Wazuh as a SIEM
2. I use MISP for the CyFORT CTI repository
3. I use Flowintel for case management

In particular, I want the alerts in my SIEM to be enriched with information from my CTI repository, and to be able to create cases in my case management system from either the SIEM, SATRAP-DL or the CTI platform/repository.

### Rationale
To enable the creation of automated workflows for diverse threat scenarios.

### Acceptance criteria
SATRAP-DL provides a mechanism/support for configuring communication channels between Wazuh, MISP, SATRAP and Flowintel, aimed at achieving a baseline for enrichment and the case creation described above.
