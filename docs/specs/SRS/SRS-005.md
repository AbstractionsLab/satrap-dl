# NoSQL data model

The data model of the CTI SKB SHALL rely on either a NoSQL graph-based or a document-based database solution or a type-theoretic polymorphic entity-relation-attribute (PERA) data model to allow for the addition of new entities and relationships without requiring a schema migration.

### Rationale
Flexibility enables further customization for specific domains, such as healthcare or military related ones.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
