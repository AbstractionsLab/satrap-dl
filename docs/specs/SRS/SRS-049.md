# Automated support for incident handling: phishing

_As a_ security manager, _I want to_ have an automated pipeline that processes potential phishing incidents relying on SATRAP-DL's stack of open-source tools for incident handling, _so that_ incident responders are automatically assigned only relevant cases based on predefined criteria. I want this pipeline to:

1. Detect connections to potentially malicious URLs and create alerts in my SIEM
2. Enrich the alerts with CTI available in my TIP
3. Run an automated preliminary analysis on the alerts to decide whether the incident needs to be escalated
4. Create a case in a case management tool if deemed necessary by the analysis
5. Add relevant playbooks to the case for further interactive analysis, e.g., using SATRAP.

### Rationale
To support automated incident handling, reducing alert fatigue and benefiting from inference-driven CTI.

### Acceptance criteria
1. The SIEM's dashboard shows identifiable alerts concerning the detection of suspicious URLs
2. Such alerts contain additional information when compared to regular alerts; this information can be traced to the integrated TIP
3. A case is automatically created for an identified malicious URL after the execution of the preliminary CTI analysis
4. The created case includes pointers to predefined playbooks to run for a phishing scenario.
5. A case is not created for a detected URL not evaluated as potentially malicious by the CTI analysis.
