# Database paradigm

The SATRAP-DL system (i.e., SATRAP) SHALL rely on a database paradigm that allows for knowledge representation
based on semantics as opposed to based on structure of the information.
Possible candidates are the PERA model and the graph model implemented by TypeDB and, e.g., Neo4J respectively.

### Rationale
To enable intrinsic semantic search capabilities and automated reasoning over the data model.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
