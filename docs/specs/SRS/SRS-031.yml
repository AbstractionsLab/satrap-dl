  The code of SATRAP-DL SHALL be statically analyzed using an appropriate software  to identify potential issues. The static analysis of Python code shall aim to detect:

  - error handling
  - commented-out code
  - input validation
  - code injection
  - concurrency and race conditions (if applicable)
  - canonical representation vulnerabilities
  - minimum amount of dependencies

  ### Rationale
  To detect common security vulnerabilities in an automated way.
