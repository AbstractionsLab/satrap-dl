# Ingestion of organizational CTI

_As a_ CTI analyst or SATRAP administrator,
_I want_ to have a configurable way to integrate CTI from MISP or OpenCTI into the CTI SKB
_so that_ our organization's internally-tracked threat intelligence is available for automated reasoning and analysis with other data in SATRAP.

For this purpose:

1. I have a way to configure my TIP API credentials and endpoint URL.
2. I can run the integration process from the CLI of SATRAP
2. SATRAP programmatically extracts STIX 2.1 bundles from either platform (e.g., via PyMISP or the OpenCTI Python SDK) and inserts them into the CTI SKB via the ETL subsystem.
4. I get notified of API authentication failures, network errors, and invalid STIX payloads with clear error messages and appropriate exit codes.
5. I get a summary at the end the ETL process and can see the log for detailed information.


### Rationale
For scenarios that deal with CTI generation and operation, we consider that a knowledge base requires information from at least three categories integrating
both, public and internal threat landscapes.
This requirement addresses the integration of organizational CTI (internal and shared with the organization).

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
