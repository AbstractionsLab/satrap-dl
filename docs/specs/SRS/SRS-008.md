# ETL subsystem

SATRAP SHALL contain a component in charge of integrating data from external sources into the CTI SKB.
This component, referred to as the ETL (extract-transform-load) subsystem, is responsible of extracting
datasets in STIX 2.1 from diverse sources, transforming them into the representation language of the
CTI SKB and loading the transformed content into the CTI SKB.

### Rationale
To provide a single means of data ingestion regardless of the data source, enforcing separation of duties and modularity in the design.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
