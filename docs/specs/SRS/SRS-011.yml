  SATRAP-DL SHALL implement a mechanism for programmatically fetching data from MISP or OpenCTI via API access or wrapper libraries (e.g., PyMISP) 
  in STIX 2.1 format, making them available for other system components to adequately process and insert the information into the CTI SKB.

  ### Rationale
