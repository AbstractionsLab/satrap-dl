  The SATRAP-DL system SHALL provide a command line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the system.
  The CLI shall support at least the following commands:

  - `setup`: Initialize the backend CTI SKB.
  - `etl`: Launch the ETL pipeline.
  - `help`: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.

  This will allow users to quickly set up the backend CTI SKB and launch the ETL pipeline without needing to navigate through a graphical user interface (GUI).
  The CLI will also provide a help command to assist users in understanding the available commands and their usage.

  ### Rationale
  To provide easy and efficient access to core data processing functionality through a command line interface (CLI) for users who prefer command line tools.
