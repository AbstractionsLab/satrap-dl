# Code static analysis

The code of SATRAP SHALL be statically analyzed using an appropriate software  to identify potential issues. The static analysis of Python code shall aim to detect:

- error handling
- commented-out code
- input validation
- code injection
- concurrency and race conditions (if applicable)
- canonical representation vulnerabilities
- minimum amount of dependencies

### Rationale
To detect common security vulnerabilities in an automated way.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
