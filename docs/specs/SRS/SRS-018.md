# Automated CTI analysis

SATRAP SHALL provide an automated mechanism for running a knowledge derivation workflow:

1. Data retrieval from the CyFORT CTI repository.
2. Execution of predefined inference queries.

Such a mechanism SHALL support customizable settings, e.g., in a configuration file.

### Rationale
For supporting automation of CTI maintenance processes, e.g, via a chron job that runs this script/program.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
