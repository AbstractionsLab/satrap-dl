# Open-source TIP integration

SATRAP-DL SHALL adopt both MISP and OpenCTI as open-source TIPs (Threat Intelligence Platform) for
central storage and management of threat intelligence data.

### Rationale
To host and manage CTI data, by relying on stable and mature solutions, without reinventing the wheel.
The choice of integrating a well-established open-source TIP would

- provide a solution capable of ingesting, storing,
and distributing threat intelligence data from various sources, including
open-source feeds, commercial feeds, and internal sources.
- provide a user-friendly interface for analysts to search, filter, and visualize
threat intelligence data.
- support integration with other security  tools and platforms, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
systems, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms,
and threat intelligence sharing platforms.
- support standardized formats for threat intelligence data, such as STIX (Structured
Threat Information Expression) and TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of
Indicator Information), to facilitate interoperability with other systems.
- support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence
feeds, including the ability to schedule updates and manage data retention
policies.
- support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence reports, including the ability to generate reports in
various formats, such as PDF, HTML, and CSV.
- support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence dashboards, including the
ability to customize the layout and content of the dashboards.
- support the ability to create and manage threat intelligence alerts,
including the ability to configure alert thresholds and notification
mechanisms.

### Acceptance criteria
