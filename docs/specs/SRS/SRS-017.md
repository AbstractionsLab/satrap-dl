# Integration of behavioral data

SATRAP SHALL implement a mechanism for retrieving data sourced by IDPS-ESCAPE from the CyFORT CTI
repository (handled by an open-source TIP), via programmatic API access.
Other SATRAP components can then adequately process and insert the information into the CTI SKB.

### Rationale
For scenarios that deal with CTI generation and operation, we consider that a knowledge base requires
information from at least three categories. This requirement addresses the integration of behavioral data.

### Acceptance criteria
See validation test case specification
