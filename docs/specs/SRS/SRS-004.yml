  The data model of the CTI SKB SHALL be extensible to accommodate for the integration of new information (e.g., facts, entities, or relationships) without requiring a complete redesign.

  Extensibility of the data model allows for gradual enrichment of the CTI SKB by combining multiple threat frameworks, as CTI might not be expressible in a single one.
