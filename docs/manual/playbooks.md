# Running investigations

We encourage you to create custom Jupyter Notebooks and playbooks to define workflows assisted by the Python `CTIAnalysisToolbox` of SATRAP while integrating functionality from related software libraries, e.g., `PyMISP` or `pycti`.

SATRAP includes two sample Jupyter notebooks to help you get started.

## Sample notebooks

**[Quick Start Notebook](/satrap/frontend/quick_start.ipynb)**

This file provides an interactive and practical introduction to the SATRAP Python `CTIAnalysisToolbox` functionality, showcasing how to execute and process the output of the available functions. By running the provided code snippets, you can get an idea of the reasoning engine used by SATRAP to derive explainable insights, such as identifying techniques used by specific threat actors (e.g., ZIRCONIUM) and formatting the results for further analysis.

**[Effective Countermeasures Playbook](/docs/notebooks/effective_measures.ipynb)**

This notebook follows the spirit of a Playbook to exemplify a step-by-step investigation for identifying and implementing countermeasures against a specific threat group. Experiment with it to see how the automated reasoning functions of the Python `CTIAnalysisToolbox` can be applied in the context of a CTI investigation case.
