    "The specifications of [ATT&CK in STIX 2.1](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/blob/master/USAGE.md#the-attck-spec) describe the representation of the following ATT&CK concepts with STIX objects:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Analysis questions\n",
    "1. Is the intrusion set \"Orangeworm\" a potential threat for the organization?\n",
